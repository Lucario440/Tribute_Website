        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Born as Narendranath Dutta on 12th January 1863 in the holy and divine
          place of Kolkata, Swami Vivekananda was a great Indian saint. He was a
          figure with “high thinking and simple living”. He was a great pious
          leader, a philosopher, and also a devout personality with great
          principles. His eminent philosophical works comprise of “Modern
          Vedanta” and “Raj Yoga”. He was a principal disciple of “Ramkrishna
          Paramhansa” and was an initiator of Ramkrishna Math and Ramkrishna
          Mission. He thus spent his whole life in the dispersion of the values
          embedded in the great Indian culture.

        <h3>Childhood Days</h3>
        <p>
          Swami Vivekananda, the son of Shri Vishwanath and mother Bhuvneshwari
          Devi was called by the name “Narendranath Dutta” in the early days.
          Narendra was a child of unquestioned expertise and intellectual
          capability who used to take grasp of all his school teachings at first
          sight. This excellence was recognized by his Gurus and thus was named
          “Shrutidhar” by them. He possessed manifold talents and skills
          comprising of swimming, wrestling which were a part of his schedule.
          Influenced by the teachings of Ramayana and Mahabharata, he had
          bottomless respect for religion. “Pavan Putra Hanuman” was his ideal
          for life. Narendra was a lover of heroism and mystical by nature.
          Despite his upbringing in a spiritual family, he owned an
          argumentative personality in his infancy. His entire beliefs were
          assisted by an apt rationale and judgment behind them. Such a quality
          made him even put a question on the existence of the Almighty. He thus
          visited several saints and asked each one “have you seen God?”His
          spiritual quest left unanswered until he met “Ramkrishna Paramhansa”.

        <h3>
          Meeting with Ramkrishna Paramhansa and Harmonization of Indian Culture
        </h3>
        <p>
          Swami Vivekananda met Ramkrishna Paramhansa for the first time when
          the latter visited his friend’s residence in Kolkata. Conscious of the
          supernatural powers of Swami Vivekananda called him to Dakshineshwar.
          He had a deep insight that Swamiji’s birth was a boon to mankind for
          the upliftment of the universe. Fulfillment of his spiritual
          inquisitiveness made he finally acknowledge Ramkrishna Paramhansa in
          the figure of his “Guru”. He was moved from darkness to illumination
          by his “Guru”. As his deep gratitude and reverence for his Guru made
          him travel all the four directions for the diffusion of his Guru’s
          teachings. Swamiji won the hearts of everyone by his incredible speech
          at Chicago by addressing the audience as “Sisters and Brothers of
          America” Vivekananda quoted these words” I am proud to belong to a
          religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal
          acceptance. We believe not only in universal tolerance but we accept
          all religions as true.” Thus, he set forward the worth of Indian
          religion exhibiting the values of universal acceptance, oneness, and
          harmony despite multiplicity in cultures. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
          once said,” Swamiji harmonized the East and the West, religion, and
          science, past and the present and that is why he is great.” He played
          a prominent role in ending India’s cultural remoteness from the rest
          of the world. A figure of highest ideals and great thoughts, Swamiji
          was an inspiration for the Youth of India. Through his teachings he
          wanted to fill the young brains with the powers of self-realization,
          character formation, to recognize inner strengths, service to others,
          an optimistic outlook, tireless efforts and a lot more.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Great Works by Swami Vivekananda</h3>
        <p>
          His famous quotations include, “Arise, awake and stop not till the
          goal is reached.” He also added that anything making a child
          physically, intellectually and spiritually weak must be rejected as a
          poison. He also emphasized on an education that leads to character
          formation. His establishment of “Ramkrishna Math” and “Ramkrishna
          Mission” was a sign of “Guru Bhakti”, his sacrifice, austerity, and
          service of the poor and the downtrodden people of India. He was also a
          founder of Belur Math. He spread the message of divinity and the true
          aims of scriptures. This great patriotic monk of the Mother Earth took
          his last breath on 4th July 1902 at Belur Math.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Swamiji carried the messages of the rich and varied heritage of Indian
          culture and Hinduism, non-duality, selfless love, and service towards
          the nation. His mesmerizing personality with the highest virtues
          illuminated the young minds. His teachings aroused the realization of
          the power of the soul in them. Thus, we celebrate his “Avtaran Divas”
          12th January, as the National Youth Day with great zeal and
          enthusiasm.
